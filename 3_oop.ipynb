    "So far you have learned about Python's core data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. In this section you will learn about the last major data structure, classes. Classes are quite unlike the other data types, in that they are much more flexible. Classes allow you to define the information and behavior that characterize anything you want to model in your program. Classes are a rich topic, so you will learn just enough here to dive into the projects you'd like to get started on."

The rules for naming a class are the same rules you learned about [naming variables](var_string_num.html#naming_rules), but there is a strong convention among Python programmers that classes should be named using CamelCase. If you are unfamiliar with CamelCase, it is a convention where each letter that starts a word is capitalized, with no underscores in the name. The name of the class is followed by a set of parentheses. These parentheses will be empty for now, but later they may contain a class upon which the new class is based."

For now, just write a comment at the beginning of your class summarizing what you intend the class to do.
